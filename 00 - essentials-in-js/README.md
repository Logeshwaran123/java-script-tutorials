# üìùEssentials in Java Script

Thus Java Script is the browser's programming language. It is widely used for various purposes and things like Front-End and Back-End Technologies in both Mobile and Web Applications development. So, today we are planning to build a strong and simple understanding about JS. Here in this session we are going to get some basic and fundamentals of js to get start with some of the important and crucial parts of the course.

## Topics Covered:

Following are the topics covered in today's session

- Java Script introduction
- console in the Browser
- Data Types in JS
- Variable Declaration Types
- Basic Operators in JS
- Type Conversion and Coercion
- Condition Statement \[if/else if/else\]
- Exercise #1 - Calculate the BMI Value
- Exercise #2 - Calculate the Leap Year
- Exercise #3 - Build a Fizz Buzz Logic

## Take aways

- Integrating the Script JS file to a Browser or HTML file.
- Browser Console
- Data Types and Variable Declarations
- Basic Operators in JS.
- Coercion and Conversion
- Truthy and Falsy Values
- Condition Statements and their Flow

## Need to Work on

_Things you consider to rework, can be added right here_

## Theoretical Concepts

What is JS?

- Java script is defined as a programming language which is object-oriented, multi-paradigm, high-level programming language.
- High-level languages are programming languages that are used for writing code that has the capacity of memory management also has higher level syntax.
- Object-oriented programming is simply a programming way which uses objects or entities of a class. More about this in future
- Multi-paradigm programming is one of the feature is JS that enables various styles of programming such Imperative and Declarative Programming.

  üìí _Imperative_: The flow of execution in the code consists of a sequence of commands for the computer to perform. Eg: C Python

  üìí _Declarative_: Declarative programming is when you write your code in such a way that it describes what you want to do, and not how you want to do it. It is left up to the compiler to figure out the how. Eg: SQL

What are Data Types?

- Data Types: It is the categorization of the data being sent to the computer memory from the translator. Such data can be of different types such as integer, string, booleans etc...
- Operators and Operands: The operators are simply the expression builders or characters which themselves has the capacity to process the values or in other hand operands.

Define Type Conversion and Coercion.

- Type Conversion - Explicit conversion one data to another data type is called as Type Conversion.
- Type Coercion - Implicit conversion of one data getting changed to another form is called as Type Coercion.

### Decision or Conditional Statements.

- Conditional Statement: Statements check whether a given data or condition returns true or false and accordingly as we defined in the control structures.

```
if (condition){

    <!-- code to be executed -->

} else if (condition) {

 <!-- code to be executed -->

} else {

<!-- code to be executed -->

}
```

### Switch Statements

- This statements are majorly used for the purpose of building a flow of conditional blocks in the orderly basis.
- case ,break ,default are some of the important keywords need to get understand the process flow or the condition of the switch statements.
- The syntax for the Switch statement is given as follows,

```
switch (case variable){
  case 'inp':
  <!-- code to be executed -->
  break;
  case 'inp':
  <!-- code to be executed -->
  <!-- continue; / break; -->
  <!-- ... multiple cases -->
  default:
  <!-- Code to be executed as default -->
  break;
}
```

### Loops in Programming:

This is simply a concept of processing certain set of instructions or code to iterate over a couple of times, until that condition becomes false. So, it is important to notice that loops in JS has so many kinds, such as for-loop, while-loop, for-of-loop etc...
As a beginner to be able to understand the process of looping we need to get used to some basic loop structures such as the for-loop and while-loop.

1. For Loops

For - loop statements has the ability to loop over a particular condition, that can be made to be initiated and ended using some point to loop over the logic in those statements or conditions.

```
for (initialization; decision; increament/decreament) {
  <!-- code to be executed -->
}
```

2. While Loops

While - loop statements are set to be executed until a certain condition.

```
while(condition){
  <!-- code to executed -->
}
```

break / continue statement:

basically the break and continue statements are used to either skip and stop or skip and play mechanism in a looping statements condition. These statements can be used for making a loop to break or continue the process of execution at the time of looping over range of value.

### Truthy and Falsy values

Since, truthy and Falsy Values are simply a bunch of values being true and false state. Such as the truthy and falsy values are given as default.

- Truthy Values: String, Number [except 0] etc...
- Falsy Values: Empyty String, 0, Empty Object, null, undefined etc...

typeof - operator : This is one of the in-built operator of JS, which can be able to return the data type of the value

Syntax

```
typeof Variable/Value
```

assignment operators - This operator can be used to assign values to a variables with hold other operations like Addition/ Subtraction /Multiplication /Division etc...
ternary operator - This operator can be used as an expression based if condition which carries the true and false from a logical condition or default truthy and falsy values.
Syntax

```
condition ? 'True Statement' : 'False Statement'
```

Operators are simply symbols or sometime keywords has a in-built process execution in the flow of operands.

Logical Operators - Operators which can be able to process the logical conditioning or expressions returning a true or false is called as logical operators.

Some Notable Operators are given as follows,

```
&& - and
|| - or
! - not
```

_**and**_ - Search for false statement from a group of logics, if exist returns false else returns true.
_**or**_ - Search for true statement from a group of logics, if exist return true else return false.
_**not**_ - Returns true when the original logic returns false and vice-versa.

Nullish Colascing - Searches for the null or undefined value from a group of statements or expressions, if exist return the other statment than null or undefined else returns false.

```
?? - Nullish Colascing
```

üìì*Note*: Short-circuiting in programming refers to the process being ended up in the middle stack of logics being processed are given as follows.

_TEMPLATE LITERAL_: Template literals are simply nothing but one of the ES 6 feature of JS to enable the printing or making strings that is made up of various kinds of strings that can be made to be used as the TEMPLATE LITERAL.

```
`${} Template literals are initiated with ` and ended with   `. The values or expressions as well as other set of Execution content can be placed inside ${} mark.
```
